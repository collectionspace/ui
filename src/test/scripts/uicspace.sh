# To add this file to the list of existing bash commands on MAC OS:
# 1. Copy the script somewhere outsife of the gitlocation so it won't be overwritten
# 2. Ensure that script works as intended after it is set up
# 3. Add the following line in your ~/.bash_profile without double quotes "alias uicspace='/path to your script file/uicspace.sh'"
# 4. Now any new terminal window with bash will recognize uicspace as a command pointing to our useful .sh script
