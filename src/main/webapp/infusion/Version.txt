This is a custom build of Fluid Infusion 1.2.x including: json, fss, framework, renderer, inlineEdit, pager and jQueryUIWidgets.

It was built from revision r10031 of the Infusion trunk, at
    http://source.fluidproject.org/svn/fluid/infusion/trunk/

using the following command:
   ant customBuild -Dinclude="json, fss, framework, renderer, inlineEdit, pager, jQueryUIWidgets" -Djsfilename="CSpaceInfusion.js" -DnoMinify="true"

This revision was used instead of the 1.2 release itself in order to include a fix to http://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-3656 as 
well as numerous other fixes to the framework, covering the areas of rendering, component expansion and IoC.
